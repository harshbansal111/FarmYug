## Problem Statement
To address inefficiencies in agricultural supply chains by reducing intermediaries between producers and consumers, enhancing transparency, reducing food waste, and stabilising price volatility, the project aims to improve food security, productivity, and market stability, thereby preventing exploitation of producers in the agricultural sector in India.

## Solution
FarmYug- A platform hosted and deployed to remove intermediaries in the agricultural sector.
Our solution is to create a digital marketplace that directly connects farmers in Punjab with consumers, removing the need for intermediaries. This platform will empower farmers by allowing them to sell their produce at fair prices, while providing consumers with fresh, affordable agricultural products. Through a user-friendly platform, farmer training workshops, consumer awareness campaigns, and support from the government, we aim to build a fairer, more efficient supply chain that works better for both farmers and consumers.

## Stakeholders
The users include farmers (agricultural producers), local vendors, wholesalers, distributors, and consumers, with local organizations for farmers and agricultural policy-makers potentially being involved as well.

## Current Technology and its Drawbacks
There are platforms like AgriBazaar, Farmerprice, and Farmlink, which are digital marketplaces for agricultural products, along with blockchain solutions for supply chain transparency and mobile apps like Digital Mandi India, offering agricultural information, market prices, and weather forecasts but are failing to provide a better mutually beneficial system.

What is missing in the current technology is transparency across the entire supply chain, smooth connectivity between consumers, farmers, and all the middle-men, a reduced number of intermediaries, and easy-to-use platforms for farmers to work on a larger scale.

## Aim
Our platform will help create a fairer system for both farmers and consumers, with sustainability at the heart of every exchange.
